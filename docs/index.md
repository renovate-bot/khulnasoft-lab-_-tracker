## Tracker: Runtime Security and Forensics using eBPF

Tracker uses eBPF technology to tap into your system and give you access to hundreds of events that help you understand how your system behaves.
In addition to basic observability events about system activity, Tracker adds a collection of sophisticated security events that expose more advanced behavioral patterns. 
Tracker provides a rich filtering mechanism that allows you to eliminate noise and focus on specific workloads that matter most to you.

**Key Features:**

* Kubernetes native installation
* Hundreds of default events
* Ships with a basic set of behavioral signatures for malware detection out of the box 
* Easy configuration through Tracker Policies 
* Kubernetes native user experience that is targetted at cluster administrators

> We release new features and changes on a regular basis. Learn more about the letest release in our [discussions.](https://github.com/khulnasoft-lab/tracker/discussions)
