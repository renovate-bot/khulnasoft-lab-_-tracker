Description: Tracker Rules: Tracker Runtime Security Detection Engine
 Tracker is a Runtime Security and forensics tool for Linux. It uses Linux eBPF
 technology, to trace your system and applications at runtime, and analyzes
 collected events to detect suspicious behavioral patterns. Tracker rules is the
 tool that receives events from Tracker eBPF and, according to defined
 signatures (REGO or Golang), warn about suspicious behavior.
